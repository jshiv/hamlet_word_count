man delights not me: no  nor woman neither  though by your smiling you seem to say so. rosencrantzmy lord  there was no such stuff in my thoughts. hamletwhy did you laugh then  when i said 'man delights not me'? rosencrantzto think  my lord  if you delight not in man  what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming  to offer you service. hamlethe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely  or the blank verse shall halt for't. what players are they? rosencrantzeven those you were wont to take delight in  the tragedians of the city. hamlethow chances it they travel? their residence  both in reputation and profit  was better both ways. rosencrantzi think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation. hamletdo they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city? are they so followed? rosencrantzno  indeed  are they not. hamlethow comes it? do they grow rusty? rosencrantznay  their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is  sir  an aery of children  little eyases that cry out on the top of question  and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion  and so berattle the common stages--so they call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither. hamletwhat  are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards  if they should grow themselves to common players--as it is most like  if their means are no better--their writers do them wrong  to make them exclaim against their own succession? rosencrantz'faith  there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was  for a while  no money bid for argument  unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question. hamletis't possible? guildensterno  there has been much throwing about of brains. hamletdo the boys carry it away? rosencrantzay  that they do  my lord; hercules and his load too. hamletit is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of denmark  and those that would make mows at him while my father lived  give twenty  forty  fifty  an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.

hamleti heard thee speak me a speech once  but it was never acted; or  if it was  not above once; for the play  i remember  pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it was--as i received it  and others  whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine--an excellent play  well digested in the scenes  set down with as much modesty as cunning. i remember  one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury  nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method  as wholesome as sweet  and by very much more handsome than fine. one speech in it i chiefly loved: 'twas aeneas' tale to dido; and thereabout of it especially  where he speaks of priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory  begin at this line: let me see  let me see-- 'the rugged pyrrhus  like the hyrcanian beast '-- it is not so:--it begins with pyrrhus:-- 'the rugged pyrrhus  he whose sable arms black as his purpose  did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd with heraldry more dismal; head to foot now is he total gules; horridly trick'd with blood of fathers  mothers  daughters  sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire and thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles  the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks.' so  proceed you. lord polonius'fore god  my lord  well spoken  with good accent and good discretion. first player'anon he finds him striking too short at greeks; his antique sword rebellious to his arm  lies where it falls repugnant to command: unequal match'd pyrrhus at priam drives; in rage strikes wide; but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls. then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow  with flaming top stoops to his base  and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus' ear: for  lo! his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam  seem'd i' the air to stick: so  as a painted tyrant  pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing. but  as we often see  against some storm a silence in the heavens  the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death  anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region  so  after pyrrhus' pause aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; and never did the cyclops' hammers fall on mars's armour forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword now falls on priam. out  out  thou strumpet  fortune! all you gods in general synod 'take away her power; break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends!' lord poloniusthis is too long. hamletit shall to the barber's  with your beard. prithee say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry  or he sleeps: say on: come to hecuba. first player'but who  o  who had seen the mobled queen--' hamlet'the mobled queen?' lord poloniusthat's good; 'mobled queen' is good. first player'run barefoot up and down  threatening the flames with bisson rheum; a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood  and for a robe about her lank and all o'er-teemed loins a blanket  in the alarm of fear caught up; who this had seen  with tongue in venom steep'd 'gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounced: but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods.' lord poloniuslook  whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes. pray you  no more. hamlet'tis well: i'll have thee speak out the rest soon. good my lord  will you see the players well bestowed?
